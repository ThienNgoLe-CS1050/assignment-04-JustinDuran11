# Assignment-04
Your program will be graded based on its correctness in running and testing. Please carefully run and test your program before turning it in. Uncompiled code will receive ZERO credit.

Warning: Read the problem carefully to ensure you follow all the specifications.

Please complete the following tasks:

Task 1:

Accept your assignment on our GitHub classroom.
   
Task 2:

Clone the repository to your local computer.
   
Task 3:

The starter code Temperature.java Temperature will hold a temperature in Fahrenheit and provide methods to get the temperature in Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. Please perform the following tasks:
   Declare the following field:
    ftemp. A double that holds a Fahrenheit temperature.

  Implement the following methods:
  
    Constructor. The constructor accepts a Fahrenheit temperature (as a double) and stores it in the ftemp
    
    setFahrenheit. This method accepts a Fahrenheit temperature (as a double) and stores it in the ftemp
    
    getFahrenheit. This method returns the value of the ftemp field, as a Fahrenheit temperature (no conversion required).
    
    getCelsius. This method returns the value of the ftemp field converted to Celsius.
    
    getKelvin. This method returns the value of the ftemp field converted to Kelvin.

  Use the following formula to convert the Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius:
  
    Celsius = (5/9) * (Fahrenheit -32)
    
   Use the following formula to convert the Fahrenheit temperature to Kelvin:
   
    Kelvin = ((5/9) * (Fahrenheit -32)) + 273

Task 4:

Implement the driver program in the starter code Temp_Demo.java. This program asks the user for a Fahrenheit temperature. The program should create an instance of the Temperature class, with the value entered by the user passed to the constructor. The program should then call the objectâ€™s methods to display the temperature in Celsius and Kelvin.

Task 5:

Commit and push your work to GitHub.
